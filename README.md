# Portfolio Analyzer
This program, when given a csv file of a list of stocks, will return the ones that it think will provide the best returns.

You can find the project file [here](Portfolio_Analyst.ipynb).

You can update the tickers file [here](Tickers.csv). Currently, it will only accept stocks that are on a Canadian or American exchange that have enough trading volume.
